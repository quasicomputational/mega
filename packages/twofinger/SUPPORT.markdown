`q4c12-twofinger` will build on GHC 8.2 and 8.0. Beginning in June 2018, this will be a rolling two-year window: the most recent patch release of all major GHC versions released within the previous two years will be supported, as well as the most recent patch release of the most recent major GHC version as of two years ago.
